PROJECTS
Minecraft Modding — Professional Software
Created and maintained multiple mods for the video game Minecraft over multiple versions of the
base game.
My most popular mod, called Iron Backpacks, is currently averaging over 1,000 downloads/day
with over 200,000 total downloads.
Learned about large projects, Iron Backpacks alone is around 18,000 lines of code.
Learned advanced Java (and OOP), Gradle, Git, and IDE usage.
Learned how to read other’s source code.
Learned the importance of clean and documented code.
Worked cooperatively with others due to the mod’s popularity  (another programmer and an artist).
Contributed to other Open Source Mods
Learned how to make good bug reports and pull requests.
Demonstrated my creativity throughout this process.
Learned time management and the importance of intrinsic discipline to a high extent,
as this was all done while enrolled full time as a student.
Made the mod open source, its code can be found here.
Android Development — Real Application
Led a team of 3 international developers (myself included) to rapidly produce a fully functional
Android Application in only 2 months.
Written in Java, it utilized a REST API to query request to an AWS Amazon Web Server to get and
post data out of the SQL database we wrote.
The app allows a user to register an account, which can be used to make vacations and
memories to show off to others.
Designed the entire user interface and any necessary graphics.
Github link available upon request (the contribution graph proves my leadership).


AWARDS
Made Dean’s List every semester I have been a student (includes high school).
My team placed 13th in the world at Odyssey of the Mind (a creative problem solving competition)
in 2010(over 100k competitors).
Member of: The National Society of Leadership and Success
and The Golden Key International Honor Society.

LANGUAGES
English; intermediate Spanish and Swedish.

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Advanced: Java      Intermediate: Python, Lua Beginning: C, Ruby

CONTINUOUS LEARNING
I have a consistent record of rapidly learning the required material and succeeding.
The proof of this is ubiquitous:
My GPA shows my ability to learn academically.
My past work experience as a professional chef at a high end restaurant, despite entering the position
knowing very little specific to the field, shows my ability to learn any skill.
My minecraft mod’s success, despite not even knowing Java when I started, shows my ability to learn
CS-related information rapidly.
My academic success while studying abroad, even though I was an undergrad placed into
a different country’s graduateprogram, shows I can succeed in challenging environments.

POSITION RELEVANT SKILLS
Working with others - Experience with both academic and professional group work.
Writing - Experience in documentation as well as professional reports.
Database queries to AWS - Used in the Android Application.
Independent, Long-term Worker - Minecraft Modding
